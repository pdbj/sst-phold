class Dot():
    """Print a series of dots to show progress.

    The class is initialized with the expected number of items.
    The processing of each item is logged by calling dot().
    This will print a dot '.' for each item, or periodically if there are
    more than 80 items.

    Whether a dot is printed

    Parameters
    ----------
    N : int
        The total number of items expected.
    level : int
        Threshold level above which printing should be suppressed
        (presumably because the caller has a more verbose progess indication).

    Methods
    -------
    dot(level: int, show=True) -> bool
        Log the processing of an item at level.  Suppress
    done()
        If any dots were printed add a newline.

        ----------
        N : int

        level : int

        ----------
        _dots_per : int
            Number of items per dot.

            True if we've printed any dots, so we add a newline when done.
